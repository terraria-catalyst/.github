## Nitrate

> [terraria-catalyst/Nitrate](https://github.com/terraria-catalyst/Nitrate)

---

An aggressive optimization mod for Terraria that moves a lot of rendering to the GPU, parallelizes many calculations, and (when possible) swaps out XNA numerics types with the JIT intrinsic/SIMD-accelerated `System.Numerics` types. Still in its infancy, *Nitrate* is being worked on constantly with the goal to speed up the game as much as possible without damaging user experience.
